The People of Paphos Knew Better

I didn’t expect to agree with Mr. Haddad on anything, but he was right about one thing: the people of Paphos are amazing — amazing for ignoring a troll like him.

My first impression of Mr. Haddad? He looked much smaller in real life — and not just in height. Usually, people who lack stature make up for it with depth or grace. Not him. He may speak three languages, but when all three are used to spread the same tired hostility, what’s the point?

I might not have paid for a ticket, but I sure paid with time — the time lost when he and his crew interrupted a quiet conversation I was having with a friend. His methods are transparent: provoke, perform, and then claim outrage as proof of victory. A troll without finesse, mistaking disruption for debate.

His worldview is one trained by a state that chooses domination instead of justice, and genocide over peace. His job exists only because of Israel’s greatest superpower — the protection it receives from powerful allies. That privilege removes any need for refinement or honesty — only the confidence to kill, displace, and silence with impunity.

Police typically face the source of aggression or potential threat — that’s standard crowd-control protocol. In Paphos, they had their backs to those holding Palestinian flags. Their eyes told the story: quiet disapproval aimed at the man who ignored their request not to provoke peaceful people standing in silence and with Palestine.
