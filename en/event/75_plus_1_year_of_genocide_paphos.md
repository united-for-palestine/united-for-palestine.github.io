Let‚Äôs show solidarity with the Palestinian national-liberation struggle and commemorate the black one-year anniversary of the intensification of the Zionist colonization of Palestine, manifesting itself as the genocidal war of extermination which the Zionist settler colony launched following the Al Aqsa Flood operation.

We demand:

- End the genocidal war against Palestine.
- End the invasion of Lebanon.
- End the constant escalation of hostilities by the Zionist entity and its allies in the region.
- End Republic of Cyprus complicity in the hostilities in the region through cooperation with the U.$., Britain and the Zionist entity.
- End the British military presence in, and occupation of, parts of the island, which facilitate the genocidal war and other hostilities in the region.
- Complete and full liberation of Palestine and permanent end to Zionist apartheid, colonization and ethnic cleansing.

There will be speeches by activists and friends of the Palestinian national-liberation struggle, and by the Cyprus Peace Council.

All friends of the struggle welcome. Bring your kuffiyehs and Palestinian flags.

- üóìÔ∏è 26 October
- üïí 16:00
- üìç In front of the Paphos Town Hall
