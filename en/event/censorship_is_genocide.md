This November 2nd, your voice and presence is now needed more than ever to call out Media outlets, in Cyprus and universally, for their abhorrent coverage of the current Genocide taking place in Palestine.

Join the international effort into highlighting the fact that over 170 journalists have been killed in Gaza in just the last year alone with total impunity and continuation of Arms Sales to the occupation force.

Kindly head to the link in our bio to sign our petition calling on all journalists and media workers affiliated with news outlets in Cyprus to:

Share non-biased, thorough reporting on the ongoing genocide in Gaza, Israel’s attacks on Lebanon, Israel’s human rights violations in the West Bank, and the Occupied Territories.
Publicize Israel’s various breaches in international law and stop whitewashing the Zionist regime in the news.
Show solidarity with their colleagues in Palestine and across the Middle East.

- November 2nd
