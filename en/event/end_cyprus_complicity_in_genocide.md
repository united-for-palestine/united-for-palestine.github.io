Stop Cypriot complicity in Israeli atrocities!

As of August 15th, 2024, the ongoing genocide has claimed the lives of over 40,000 Palestinian civilians at the hands of the Israeli army, including 16,500 children. More than 92,400 individuals have been injured, and over 10,000 remain missing, buried beneath the rubble. The genocide and atrocities against the Palestinian people continue unabated.

The government of Cyprus cannot claim neutrality in this tragedy. By providing continuous support to Israel, it is complicit in the genocide.

United for Palestine Larnaca is organizing a sit-in demonstration at Meli Nikolaidi, Larnaca Port, on Sunday, August 25th, at 6:00 PM. We urge you to join us in demanding that the Cypriot government immediately cease all forms of cooperation and collaboration with Israel, including:

- Halting the transfer of military supplies to Israel via Cypriot ports and airbases.
- Denying docking rights to Israeli military and commercial vessels at all Cypriot ports.
- Restricting Israeli investments in tourism and property development within Cyprus.
- Officially demanding an immediate end to Israeli atrocities against Palestinians.
- Supporting and endorsing the Palestinian people's rights to return, freedom, self-determination, and statehood.

We must stand together against these injustices and demand accountability!
