ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¸ Join us to commemorate the victims of Israeli war crimes in Palestine and Lebanon as we approach the one year mark in which the live-streamed genocide has opened the Western public's eyes to the horrifying impact of Zionism and colonialism.

ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡§ As Israel, backed by Western allies, expands its war, the Cypriot public is propelled into sever danger without any protection from its governing political party.

ðŸš¨ Drastic changes of direction must be made to de-escalate military action on all fronts, bring Israel to account and lay a path forward to decolonisation, peace and justice.

ðŸ“Œ Meet us at 4pm, October 5th, on Anexartisias Street (opposite Zara) to find out more about the historical context, current events and stand in solidarity with Palestine & Lebanon.
