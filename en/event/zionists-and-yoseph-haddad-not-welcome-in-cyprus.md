On 20/10, Yoseph Haddad - defender of Israeli war crimes - is holding an event at Markideio Theatre Paphos.

He claims we "rarely get to hear from the people living this reality" [1], disregarding the Palestinian voices from the ground in Gaza that documented this genocide for two years [3]. He claims the event is free from politics, yet his words and beliefs echo the same Zionist propaganda as the Israeli regime. He claims the Israel-Palestine "conversation" is filled with "noise" [1]. It is not noise to stand with the oppressed. It is not noise to stand for truth.

With his words that Gazans are "barbaric terrorists" who should be "eliminated" [2], it's clear Haddad is an export of Israeli propaganda. 

How do you feel about your cultural spaces being used to support genocide? In a country with hate speech laws the government fails to enforce[4], it's critical we make a stand against Zionism. Join us on 20/10 for a silent protest outside Markideio Theatre.
