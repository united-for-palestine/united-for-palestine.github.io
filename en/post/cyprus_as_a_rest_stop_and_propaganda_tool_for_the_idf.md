A wellness retreat and healing spa near the sleepy town of Miliou serves as a rest stop and propaganda tool for the [IDF][IDF].

The [David & Laura Merage Foundation][merage_foundation], through its [Wings][wings] program, uses the Cyprus spa resort to support lone soldiers.  Massages and nature walks are offered to those who [directly participated in the Gaza Genocide][gaza_to_cyprus]. After some much-needed relaxation, the soldiers either continue their "service" in the IDF or transition into "civil" society.

> Each year the Wings program provides more than 3,000 immigrant youth and lone soldiers with the tools they need to enter Israeli society as confident and active citizens. In partnership with the [Jewish Agency][jewish_agency], Wings offers a continuum of services, from the time they first arrive in Israel and years after their release from the IDF, helping them achieve their personal goals and aspirations.

The function of these articles is clearly to appeal to young people seeking a better future. They aim to make the idea of joining the IDF attractive and desirable by offering perks like a vacation, assistance with finding an apartment, and more.

> From a financial advisor who helps with rental agreements, cell phone plans, and opening a bank account to an occupational psychologist who helps with academic studies and career placement the Wings program aims to facilitate this transition.

After injuring and traumatizing these young individuals, the Merage Foundation offers them [healing retreats][merage_healing_retreats] in Cyprusâ€”a band-aid on a bullet wound. For those killed by resistance fighters, they offer the [Cyprus weekend for mourning parents][merage_parent_vacation]. These parents, like any, would choose their son over the ambitions of Israel, a state that prioritizes land and war over the well-being of its citizens.

> The Golani Brigade's 13th and 51st Battalions suffered heavy casualties during the Hamas offensive of southern Israel in October 2023. According to the Israel Defense Forces at least 72 Golani soldiers were killed and an unknown number had been captured while defending the Iron Wall. This was by far the highest number of fatalities for any single unit in the IDF during the offensive. Golani soldiers were underequipped and overstretched all along the border and were not able to repel the militants on the first line of military bases and kibbutzim that they assigned numerous platoons to defend.

Lives are irreparably damaged as Israel pursues conflict-driven policies and disregards a path of peace and stability, failing to serve its own citizens and soldiers. Meanwhile, some on our island offer to massage the feet of those who use them to trample on the Palestinians and Lebanese.

Cyprus assists Israel in actions that violate international law and contribute to humanitarian crises. Nations have an obligation to refrain from supporting actions that may exacerbate violence and suffering, especially in situations where allegations of genocide and breaches of international law are raised.

Although Nikos Christodoulides has [reiterated][reiterated] that Cyprus only functions as a humanitarian corridor, it is evident that he either lacks awareness of the realities in Cyprus and abroad or is not fully grasping the implications of this stance.
