Yesterday at 4:00 PM, residents and activists gathered in front of the Paphos Town Hall to protest in a show of solidarity with the Palestinian people and honoring the black one year anniversary since the intensification of the Israeli colonization of Palestine and the start of large-scale ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The protest, titled “75 + 1 Year of Genocide: Lasting Peace for Palestine Now”, was organized by United For Palestine (UFP) – Paphos chapter and the Cyprus Peace Council (CPC), and included speeches in Greek and English, chants in Greek, English and Arabic, and a march through the commercial center of the city.

The protesters demanded an end to the genocidal war of extermination waged by Israel in Gaza since the events of 7 of October last year, an end to the ongoing invasion of Lebanon by Israel, as well as an end to the constant escalation of hostilities in the region by Israel and its western allies.

The Republic of Cyprus was condemned as complicit in the slaughter and escalations due to its economic, military and intelligence cooperation with the United States, Britain and Israel, and demands were made to end the inclusion, whether indirect or direct, of Cyprus in all hostilities in the region. The protesters also called for an end to the military presence of the British imperialists in Cyprus, including the occupation of Cypriot land by Britain with its Sovereign Base Areas, which constitute forward operating bases for the slaughter in Palestine and Lebanon and for other hostilities in the region.

Finally, demands were made for the complete and full liberation of Palestine from Zionism and end to apartheid, colonization and ethnic cleansing by Israel.

The march through Paphos’ commercial center included chants by the protesters in a similar vein. The march concluded in Kennedy Square, with renewed calls for the end of genocidal war in Gaza, and calls for continued advocacy in pursuit of justice and permanent peace in the region.
