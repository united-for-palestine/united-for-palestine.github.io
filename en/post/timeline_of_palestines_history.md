**1 Year of Genocide!** Gaza is facing an unparalleled humanitarian disaster, with over 42,000 Palestinians reported killed and estimates suggesting the death toll could eventually exceed 186,000, or 8% of Gaza's population.

- More than 650 Palestinians have been killed, including 146 in airstrikes, with many civilian casualties.
- More than 10,000 Palestinians have been arrested.
- Around 5,500 have been injured in clashes, raids, and settler violence.
- Additionally, 1,478 Palestinian structures have been demolished, displacing over 3,500 people.
- Settler violence has surged, with over 1,300 attacks against Palestinians, further exacerbating the situation.

This escalation has deepened tensions, led to widespread unrest, and caused extensive destruction of homes and infrastructure.
